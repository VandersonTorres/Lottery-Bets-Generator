# Lottery-Games-Generator

This project simulates the probability of winning a lottery bet. With a “Object-Oriented” code, it allows users to place as many bets as they want, and while program is running, is possible to see the bets being placed. If eventually user hits any sequency, the app brake and presents a message, if not, the exception is treated and user can keep on or exit.

“There is already a winner sequency as a parameter (Global variable ‘sena_2021’)”
